            "description": "The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Out-of-bounds heap write in systemd-networkd dhcpv6 option handling (CVE-2018-15688) * systemd: stack overflow when calling syslog from a command with long cmdline (CVE-2018-16864) * systemd: stack overflow when receiving many journald entries (CVE-2018-16865) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section. Red Hat would like to thank Ubuntu Security Team for reporting CVE-2018-15688 and Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865.
