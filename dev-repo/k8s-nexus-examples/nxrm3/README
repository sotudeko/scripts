This deployment mounts a volume on the node at /mnt/nxrm3/sonatype-work.

Before running the scripts:
1. Access the node - minikube ssh
2. sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nxrm3/sonatype-work
3. sudo chmod 777 /mnt/nxrm3/sonatype-work 

I'm sure there's a way to auto do all this but havent figured it out, and in any case, the mount dir would be
replaced with a NFS server filesystem.
